# **Random Acts of Kindness**

The Random Acts of Kindness App is a web application I made for phase-2 of my software development degree at Flatiron School that allows users to share and discover acts of kindness. This README file provides an overview of the app's features and instructions for setting up and running the application.

# **Features**
- Post Acts of Kindness: Users can create and share their own acts of kindness with the community. Each post can include a description of the act, and optionally, any relevant media such as photos or videos.

- Discover Acts of Kindness: Users can explore and view acts of kindness posted by other users. The app provides a feed or timeline where users can scroll through the acts, read their descriptions, and view any accompanying media.

- Interact with Acts: Users can interact with the acts of kindness posted by others through interactive buttons. These buttons allow users to express their appreciation for an act, letting others know who else did it, or even express the intention to do it.

# CSS Framework
The React Kindness App utilizes the [**Bulma**](bulma.io)  CSS framework for styling and layout purposes. Bulma is a modern, lightweight CSS framework that provides a responsive grid system and a set of predefined styles and components.

To take advantage of Bulma's features and styles, the necessary CSS files have been imported in the html file:  `<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bulma@0.9.4/css/bulma.min.css">`

If you are new to Bulma, please refer to the official Bulma documentation for more information on how to utilize its features and customize the styles according to your needs.
