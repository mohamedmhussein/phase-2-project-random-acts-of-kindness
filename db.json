Feeling helpless, she frantically searched for her phone, but realized she had left it at the office. Just as despair was starting to set in, I pulled over to offer assistance. I had noticed Sarah's predicament and immediately offered to call a tow truck and stay with her until help arrived. My act of kindness not only provided practical assistance, but also comforted Sarah during a vulnerable and stressful situation."
